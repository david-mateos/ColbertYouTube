To run, in a new Google Sheet, click Tools > Script editor 
Make sure you turn on the YouTube Data API by clicking Resources > Advanced Google Services
Note: You must also have the same API enabled in the Google Developer Console

Either refresh your new sheet or check your Google Drive for the new sheet. 
You can also replace the channelID if Colbert isn't your speed.
